## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where you want to install the bot.
   - Run the following command:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/htquangg/nodepaybot.git
     ```
   - This will create a new directory named `nodepaybot` with the project files.

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   - Change into the newly created directory:
     ```
     cd nodepaybot
     ```

3. Open the `data.txt` file in a text editor and add your account tgWabAppData, one per line:
